## Description
Repository of the project developed for the "Prova Finale di Reti Logiche" (Final test of Logic Arrays) course, part of the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering at Politecnico di Milano.

This final test aims at assessing the students ability to implement an algorithm on a low-level hardware language such as VHDL, under time and memory constraints on a FPGA.

This repository refers to the 2017 edition of the course, whose main topic is a VHDL implementation of an algorithm that, given a matrix and a threshold in input, evaluates the area of the largest rectangle defined by values above the threshold.
Simulation had to be done both in Behavioral and Post-Synthesis, paying attention to the area occupied on the FPGA and the frequency of the clock.
