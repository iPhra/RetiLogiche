# matrix-area

This is the repository for the project "Prova finale di Reti Logiche" (Final test of Logic Design) by Politecnico di Milano.  
It's a VHDL implementation of an algorithm that, given a matrix and a threshold in input, evaluates the area of the largest rectangle defined by values above the threshold.  
Simulation had to be done both in Behavioral and Post-Synthesis, paying attention to the area occupied on the FPGA and the frequency of the clock.
